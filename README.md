# NYC Bicycle Traffic Patterns

## Objectives

Use the dataset given, which captures information about bike usage in New York City. See below for the analysis questions that are answered.

## Bike traffic

The `nyc_bicycle_counts_2016.csv` gives information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City. In this path, the analysis questions that have been answered are as follows:

1. You want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But you only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?
2. The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast(low/high temperature and precipitation) to predict the total number of bicyclists that day? 
3. Can you use this data to predict what *day* (Monday to Sunday) is today based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?

`readme-nyc_bicycle_counts_2016.pdf` details the information contained in the data field.

* `MiniProject.pdf`: A project report, consists of:
  * A section describing the dataset I worked with.
  * A section describing the analyses I chose to use for each analysis question (with a justification of why I chose that analysis and what I expected the analysis to tell me).
  * A section describing the results of each analysis, and what my answers to the questions are based on my results.
