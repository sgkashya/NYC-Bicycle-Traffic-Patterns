# NYC Bicycle Traffic Patterns

## Objectives

Use the dataset given, which captures information about bike usage in New York City. See below for the analysis questions that are answered.

## Bike traffic

The `nyc_bicycle_counts_2016.csv` gives information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City. In this path, the analysis questions that have been answered are as follows:

1. You want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But you only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?
2. The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast(low/high temperature and precipitation) to predict the total number of bicyclists that day? 
3. Can you use this data to predict what *day* (Monday to Sunday) is today based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?

`readme-nyc_bicycle_counts_2016.pdf` details the information contained in the data field.

* `report.pdf`: A project report, which should consist of:
  * A section with the names of the team members (maximum of two), your Purdue username(s), and the path (1 or 2 or 3) you have taken, with the github repository link.
  * A section describing the dataset you are working with.
  * A section describing the analyses you chose to use for each analysis question (with a paragraph or two justifying why you chose that analysis and what you expect the analysis to tell you).
  * A section (or more) describing the results of each analysis, and what your answers to the questions are based on your results. Visual aids are helpful here to back up your conclusions. **Note that, it is OK if you do not get "positive" answers from your analysis, but you must explain why that might be**.

* All Python `.py` code files you wrote to complete the analysis steps.
